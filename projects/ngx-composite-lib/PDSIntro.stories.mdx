#### About PELC

PELC is represented by the following:

- Atoms (styles, buttons, icons, inputs, etc')
- Molecules (dialogs, filters, image filmstrip, etc')
- Organisms (header, footer, etc')
- Templates (login, dialog with a form, list in a page, etc')
- Pages (Order center for a _buyer_ or as a _rep_)

> In `ngx-composite-lib` storybook you'll only find _Organisms_, _Templates_, _Pages_ - for _Atoms_ and _Molecules_ you'll need to see `ngx-lib` storybook
